## Description

The `satellite_pe_tools` module configures Puppet's report processor and facts indirector to allow you to send Puppet reports and facts to your Red Hat Satellite server.

## Setup

### Setup requirements

This module requires Red Hat Satellite 6.2 and Puppet Enterprise (PE) 2016.4 or later.

### Beginning with satellite\_pe\_tools

1. [Classify Puppet servers](#classify-puppet-servers)
2. [Set Puppet server facts terminus](#set-puppet-server-facts-terminus)
3. [Allow Puppet server to send data to Satellite](#allow-puppetâ€“server-to-send-data-to-satellite)
4. [Allow Puppet server to verify Satellite server identity](#allow-puppet-server-to-verify-satellite-server-identity)
5. [Allow Satellite server to verify Puppet server identity](#allow-satellite-server-to-verify-puppet-server-identity)
6. [Enable pluginsync and reports in Puppet](#enable-pluginsync-and-reports-in-puppet)

To set up communication between Satellite and your Puppet servers, follow these steps:

1. Classify Puppet servers

   Add the `satellite_pe_tools` class to the PE server node group in the PE Console. For details on adding classes to node groups, see the [Puppet Enterprise documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/console_classes_groups.html#adding-classes-to-a-node-group).

2. Set Puppet server facts terminus

   In the PE server node group in the PE Console, add the `facts_terminus`
parameter to the `puppet_enterprise::profile::server` class with a string value of 'satellite'. This sets Puppet runs on your Puppet servers to forward the facts to Satellite.

3. Allow the Puppet server to verify the Satellite server's identity

   To use SSL verification so that the Puppet server can verify the Satellite server (to prevents man-in-the-middle attacks), the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate that signed the Satellite server's SSL certificate must be available on the Puppet server.

   By default, the CA certificate is located on the Satellite CA server. On Red Hat-based systems, this is automatically managed by the module. Note that the CA cert is transferred over an untrusted SSL connection. If you wish to transfer the cert manually, see below. You must also set the `manage_default_ca_cert` parameter to `false`.

   On non-Red Hat systems, or if you wish to manually transfer the cert, copy the file `/etc/pki/katello/certs/katello-default-ca.crt` from the Satellite CA server to `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/katello-default-ca.crt` on each Puppet server. If you place the certificate in a different location or give it a different name, you must set the `ssl_ca` parameter for the `satellite_pe_tools` class to the file path of the CA certificate.

   If the Satellite SSL certificate is signed by a remote CA, copy the remote CA's certificate to each Puppet server, and then set the `ssl_ca` parameter for the `satellite_pe_tools` class to the file path of the CA certificate.

   If you do not wish to verify the identity of the Satellite server, you can set the[`verify_satellite_certificate`](#verify_satellite_certificate) parameter for the `satellite_pe_tools` class to `false`.

4. Allow the Satellite server to verify the Puppet server's identity

   By default, Satellite is configured to verify the SSL identity of the PE servers connecting to it. If the PE report processor and facts indirector are not using a certificate signed with the Satellite server's CA, the verification fails.

   To use SSL verification so that the Satellite server can verify the Puppet server, you must generate a SSL cert and key pair on the Satellite server, and then copy these files to your Puppet server.

  > Note: In the following steps, replace `puppet.example.com` with the FQDN of your Puppet server.

  1. On the Satellite server, run the following command:

            capsule-certs-generate --foreman-proxy-fqdn "puppet.example.com" \
            --certs-tar "~/puppet.example.com-certs.tar"

       > Note: Use `--capsule-fqdn` instead of `--foreman-proxy-fqdn` for Satellite versions older than 6.3

  2. Untar the newly created file:

            tar -xvf ~/puppet.example.com-certs.tar

     This creates a new folder: `~/ssl-build`. This may contain either raw `.crt` and `.key` file, or a number of RPM files.

  3. If the ssl-build folder contains RPM files for the host, find and extract the contents of the puppet-client rpm file:

            cd ~/ssl-build/puppet.example.com
            rpm2cpio puppet.example.com-puppet-client-1.0-1.noarch.rpm | cpio -idmv

     This creates a folder structure in the current directory beginning with `./etc/pki/katello-certs-tools/`

  4. Locate the `.crt` and `.key` files to your Puppet server. They are found either at:

            ~/ssl-build/puppet.example.com/puppet.example.com-puppet-client.crt
            ~/ssl-build/puppet.example.com/puppet.example.com-puppet-client.key

     Or if you had to extract them from the RPM:
     
            ~/ssl-build/puppet.example.com/etc/pki/katello-certs-tools/certs/puppet.example.com-puppet-client.crt
            ~/ssl-build/puppet.example.com/etc/pki/katello-certs-tools/private/puppet.example.com-puppet-client.key

     Copy the files to `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/satellite` on your Puppet server.

  5. On your Puppet server, set the ownership of these two files to `pe-puppet`:

     Example (adjust paths and filenames accordingly):

            chown pe-puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/satellite/puppet.example.com-puppet-client.crt
            chown pe-puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/satellite/puppet.example.com-puppet-client.key

  6. In the Satellite UI, go to *Administer -> Settings -> Auth* and set the `restrict_registered_smart_proxies` parameter to `true`. Additionally, add your Puppet server's FQDN to the `trusted_hosts` array on the same page; for example, `[puppet.example.com]`.

     `trusted_hosts` has been given the label "Trusted hosts" in the UX. You can see the actual setting names by mousing over the label.

  7. Set the `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` parameters in your `satellite_pe_tools` class to the location on your Puppet server of the two files respectively.

     If you do not want the Satellite server to verify the Puppet server identity, then in the Satellite UI, go to *Administer -> Settings -> Auth* and set the `restrict_registered_smart_proxies` parameter to `false`.

     Note that this setting presents a security risk. False reports and facts can be sent to Satellite by a malicious system masquerading as a current Puppet server on your infrastructure that's been added to Satellite as a safe server.

5. Enable pluginsync and reports in Puppet

   On each Puppet agent, make sure the [`pluginsync`](https://docs.puppet.com/latest/configuration.html#pluginsync) and [`report`](https://docs.puppet.com/latest/configuration.html#report) settings are enabled. These settings are usually enabled by default.

        [agent]
        report = true
        pluginsync = true

6. Enable integration of Satellite node data into Puppet

  1. Set the `trusted_external_command` parameter in your `satellite_pe_tools` class to `true`. This will install a trusted external command script which Puppet will use to read node data from Satellite, making it available as `trusted.external.satellite` (e.g. in a Puppet manifest, `getvar('trusted.external.satellite')`).

  2. In your site.pp file, add the following function call. This will make Puppet include any classes Satellite specifies for nodes.

            satellite_pe_tools::include_satellite_classes()

## Usage

~~~puppet
class {'satellite_pe_tools':
  satellite_url                => "https://puppet.example.com",
  verify_satellite_certificate => true,
}
~~~

This example tells the Puppet server the location of the Satellite server (`https://puppet.example.com`) and instructs it to verify the Satellite server's identity.

## Debugging

In addition to the reports in the Puppet Enterprise Console, the Satellite API log and the Puppet server log can help you debug issues.

The Satellite API log file is located at `/var/log/httpd/foreman-ssl_access_ssl.log` on your Satellite server.

An example of a SSL authentication failure (note the '403'):

```puppet
10.32.125.164 - - [03/Oct/2015:16:06:19 -0700] "POST /api/reports HTTP/1.1" 403 58 "-" "Ruby"
```

An example of a sucessful SSL authentication (note the '201'):

```puppet
10.32.125.164 - - [03/Oct/2015:16:06:00 -0700] "POST /api/reports HTTP/1.1" 201 554 "-" "Ruby"
```

The Puppet server log file is located at `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log` on your Puppet server. 

An example of a DH PARAMETER failure:

```puppet
2018-03-04 15:16:17,161 ERROR [qtp1111094392-103] [puppetserver] Puppet Could not send report to Satellite: Could not generate DH keypair
```

You can resolve this error by adding a DH PARAMETER block to the custom certificate on the Satellite server.

```bash
openssl dhparam 1024 >> /etc/pki/katello/certs/katello-apache.crt
satellite-maintain restart
```
